### About Me

I am a recent graduate from Technische Universiteit Delft, with a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in Psychology from Universiteit Leiden. My academic journey has honed my skills in software engineering, data analysis, and AI, and my research experience in human-robot collaborative surgery has equipped me with strong teamwork and problem-solving abilities. I am passionate about leveraging my technical skills and collaborative mindset in a dynamic work environment to drive innovative solutions and contribute to impactful projects.


> **A Note on My GitHub:**
> Many of my significant academic projects, including those involving Java/Spring, were hosted on my university's private TU Delft GitLab instance, which I no longer have access to post-graduation.

### My Projects

Here are some selected projects that highlight my backend development and problem-solving skills.

---

#### 1. Real-Time Flight Simulator Systems
*   **Company:** Multi Pilot Simulations
*   **Role:** Software Engineer
*   **Tech Stack:** C#, Internal Debugging & Development Tools

As a Software Engineer in the development department, I work on A320 CEO/NEO, B737NG, and B737MAX simulators. My role is focused on ensuring the highest level of reliability and safety for pilot training.

*   **Problem:** The software that runs these simulators is incredibly complex, with a constant need to fix bugs, improve performance, and integrate new features to match the performance of the real aircrafts.
*   **My Contribution:**
    *   I debug and resolve software issues across various modules, from flight dynamics to flight management system, improving the simulator to be as close as possible to the real aircraft systems.
    *   I contribute to the development of new features, writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code in C#.
    *   I collaborate closely with a team of engineers to test and validate software updates, maintaining the integrity of our safety-critical systems.

#### 2. Full-Stack Cloud Translation Service
*   **Company:** Amazon Web Services (Internship)
*   **Role:** Software Engineering Intern
*   **Tech Stack:** Java, Python, AWS (Lambda, S3, API Gateway), JavaScript, REST APIs

During my internship at AWS, I worked in a group that was tasked with developing a solution to make technical content more accessible.

*   **Problem:** High-quality AWS Blog Posts are a key resource but are often unavailable in low-resource languages like Turkish, creating a barrier for local developers.
*   **My Contribution:**
    *   We designed and developed a full-stack web application that automated the translation of English blog posts into Turkish.
    *   I worked on the architecture of the backend using a serverless approach on AWS, using Java and Python for the core logic within AWS Lambda functions.
    *   I created RESTful APIs using API Gateway to handle requests between the frontend and the backend translation services.
    *   This project gave me hands-on experience in designing a scalable and cloud-native application.

#### 3. Secure Authentication Microservice
*   **Context:** TU Delft, Software Engineering Methods Project
*   **Role:** Software Engineer
*   **Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Microservices, Design Patterns

This project was a deep dive into modern software engineering practices and backend architecture.

*   **Problem:** An application required a robust and secure system for handling user authentication and authorization.
*   **My Contribution:**
    *   I took lead responsibility for the authentication module of the application.
    *   I designed and implemented a dedicated microservice using Spring Boot.
    *   I integrated Spring Security to handle user registration.
    *   I followed established design patterns to ensure the service was decoupled, testable, and could be easily integrated with other parts of the application.

#### 4. Object-Oriented Application Development
*   **Context:** TU Delft, Object Oriented Programming Project
*   **Role:** Software Engineer
*   **Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Framework, OOP Principles

This was a foundational project focused on building a well-structured application using core object-oriented principles.

*   **Problem:** Develop a functional application that is maintainable, extensible, and well-designed.
*   **My Contribution:**
    *   I worked on developing a complete application using the Spring Framework to manage dependencies and application structure.
    *   My focus was on applying OOP concepts like inheritance to create a clean and logical codebase.
    *   This project solidified my core understanding of Java and Spring.
